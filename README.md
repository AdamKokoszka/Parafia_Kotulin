# Parish website

#### The first major project based on many subpages.
>On the website you will find all information about the parish in Kotulin.
The whole is divided into many subpages on which we can move thanks to navigation.
We can see the dynamic part of the page in the **announcements** tab.
Data is retrieved from the database which needs to be updated every week by adding advertisements using the **special panel**.

The page can be seen on [kotulin.opole.opoka.org.pl](http://www.kotulin.opole.opoka.org.pl).
